8.2.4 (L1) Ensure communication with Skype users is disabled

This test checks if the communication with Skype users is disabled.

This policy setting controls chat with external unmanaged Skype users. Note: Skype for business is deprecated as of July 31, 2021, although these settings may still be valid for a period of time. See the link in the reference section for more information.

Rationale:\
Skype was deprecated July 31, 2021. Disabling communication with skype users reduces the attack surface of the organization. If a partner organization or satellite office wishes to collaborate and has not yet moved off of Skype, then a valid exception will need to be considered for this recommendation.

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Teams admin center** [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
