We have added a lot of new features and improvements based on your feedback. Thank you for that! 🙏

## What's new since we launched v1 in December 2024

It’s taken a whole village to bring you **Maester v1**. Here are some of the highlights:

### 🌟 **New Tests**

We've added a whole bunch of new tests to check your security configuration, growing from 194 to 286! 🎉 Check out the [test list](/docs/tests) for the full breakdown.

#### ORCA

[Mike Soule](/blog/authors/mike) came up with the idea to integrate [Cam Murray](https://github.com/cammurray)'s excellent [Office 365 Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA)](https://github.com/cammurray/orca) with Maester.

We reached out to Cam and he was all for helping Microsoft customers become more secure. With the greenlight, Mike started integrating ORCA and we had amazing support from [Thomas Schmidt](/blog/authors/thomasschmidt) who really helped improve the quality and polish of the ORCA tests in Maester. Call out to [Cameron Moore](https://github.com/moorereason) who pitched in with a huge number of PRs.

You can read more about this in our previous blog post [Maester adds ORCA tests](/blog/maester-with-orca)

#### App risk tests

* New application risk tests based on the Azure Tiering research by Emilien Socchi. Thanks to ... (todo put names) for their contributions.

Note: Since these tests take a long time to run (downloads all service principals which can take hours for large tenants) we don't run them by default. Use -Tag 'Full' to run these.
