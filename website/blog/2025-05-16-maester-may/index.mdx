#### App risk tests
* New application risk tests based on the Azure Tiering research by Emilien Socchi. Thanks to ... (todo put names) for their contributions.

Note: Since these tests take a long time to run (downloads all service principals which can take hours for large tenants) we don't run them by default. Use -Tag 'Full' to run these.
