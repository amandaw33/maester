# App registrations should no longer use secrets

## Description

Use [federated credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp) or [certificates](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-self-signed-certificate) instead of secrets. Secrets are considered unsafe.
